<h2>Rules of the game</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Ranking of the cards in whist</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The ranking by number, from strong to weak: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9,..., 3, 2</li>
        <li>The ranking by suit, from strong to weak: NT (No Trump), ♠, <span style="color:red">♥</span>, <span style="color:red">♦</span>, ♣.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Dealing of the cards</h3>
        A round begins by dealing out all the cards (without jokers) to four players. 
        The dealer is switched every round in a clockwise direction, so that the player
        to the left of the current dealer is the next dealer. Each player receives 13 cards 
        that remain hidden from the other players.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Bidding</h3>
        In Israeli whist there are two rounds of bidding: a round to determine the trump 
        suit and a round to determine the contract.
        <p>
            <h4>The bidding that determines the trump suit</h4>
            <ol>
            <li>After the dealing of the cards, the player sitting to the left of the dealer "calls".
            He can choose one of two options: Say "pass", or to bid. Bidding includes the number of future
            tricks (contract) given a certain trump suit. For example: "5 hearts" means "If the trump is 
            hearts, I will contract at least 5 tricks". The minimal bid at this point is 5, in other words,
            if a player will not obligate himself to take at least 5 tricks, he will say "pass".</li>
            <li>Next, the player to the left of the previous "caller" makes his "call". He can say "pass",
            or bid higher than the highest bid so far. A higher bid can be stronger in suit (for example
            5♠ is stronger than 5♦), or in number (6♥ is stronger than 5♠).</li>
            <li>The "calling" continues in a clockwise direction.</li>
            <li>The bid that determines the trump is the one that after it there are three "passes" in 
            a row. Meaning, all the other players declare that they do not want bid higher. At this point
            the trump suit is determined.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>The bidding that determines the contract</h4>
            After the trump suit is determined, there is another bidding round in which the "contracts"
            are determined – that is, the number of tricks a player declares he will take. The first to
            bid is the winner of the previous bidding (that determined the trump suit). In his bid, he
            says the number of tricks he will win; the number of tricks must be at least the number he
            declared in the previous bidding round. Next bids the player to his left, which can bid as
            many as he likes (between 0 and 13), and so do the other two in turn. The last player to
            bid is not allowed to make a bid that makes the sum of all four bids 13, because then all
            four players might be able to succeed in the round. So the last player to bid determines if
            the sum is more than 13 (an "over" game) or less than 13 (an "under": game). The meaning is
            that at least one player will not take enough tricks in an "over" game, and will take too
            many in an "under" game.
        </p>        
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>A Game Round</h3>
        After all the cards are dealt and the trump and the contracts established, there are 13 game 
        rounds, in which each player puts down a card and the player that puts down the strongest card
        takes the trick.    
        <p>
            <h4>Putting down the cards</h4>
            In the first game round, the first to put down a card is the winner of the first bid, next
            is the player to his left, and so on. In the other game rounds, the winner of the previous
            round plays first. The first player of the round is allowed to put down any of his cards
            and all the other players must follow suit (put down cards of the same suit). If a player
            doesn't have cards of the same suit, he may put down any other card that he has. If a player
            does have cards of the same suit, but puts down cards of another suit, and is later caught
            (he will have to put down all his cards eventually) he is fined 100 points. If a player
            doesn't have cards of the same suit, he may put down a card that is not of the trump suit,
            and then he surely losses the trick, or he may "cut" (put down a trump card).
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Who takes the trick</h4>
            After all four cards have been put down, the winner of the trick is determined, the highest
            card of the suit that started the round wins, unless trump cards are put down, and in that
            case, the strongest trump wins. The player to win the trick is the one to start the next round.
            When playing with no trump (NT), the rules are the same, only there is no option to cut, so a
            player that does not have the leading suit loses the trick for sure.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Example of a game round</h4>
            An example round (diamond is trump): player A leads with a 9♣, player B Q♣, Player C 7
            <span style="color:red">♦</span>, player D 8♣. Notice that player C has no clubs, or else he
            would have to put down a club, so he has two options, to get rid of a card that is not trump,
            or to try to win the trick with a trump. Player D had clubs, so he had to put down a club and
            could not put down a trump, and so Player C wins the trick.
        </p>        
    </p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>
    The object of the game is to win exactly the number of trick in the contract, no more and no less.
    <ul>
    <li>If a player makes his contract (with zero as the exception), he will receive the number of tricks
    squared plus ten. For example, a player that made a contract of three and did take three tricks will
    get 19 points (3*3+10=19).</li>
    <li>If a player does not make his contract (with zero as the exception), he will get minus ten points
    for each deviation (too many or too less) from his contract. Therefore, if a player bids 4 and wins 6,
    he will lose 20 points.</li>
    <li>A player that bids zero and makes it, will receive 50 points in an "under" game (the sum of bids
    is less than 13) and 25 in an "over" game (the sum of bids is more than 13).</li>
    <li>A player that bids zero and does not make it loses 50 point if he wins one trick. If he wins more
    than one trick, for each additional trick he receives 10 points. So a player that bids zero and wins
    one will get –50 points, and if he wins 2, he will get –40 points. Therefore, after winning one trick
    the player will want to win as many more additional tricks as he can.</li>
    </ul>
